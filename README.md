PROJECT: RISC-V Multi-mode Processor with Supervisor and Debug Support
A graduation project focused on processor design, privilege modes, and debug integration.

Objective:
Design and implement a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor supporting User, Supervisor, and Debug modes, along with the associated software toolchain and hardware validation.

Responsibilities:
1) Designed a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor supporting User, Supervisor, and Debug modes. 
2) Developed a custom RISC-V assembler and an instruction set simulator (ISS) with privilege-level handling and debug mode functionalities. 
3) Implemented supervisor mode support and integrated debug registers into the ISS and processor RTL. 
4) Performed hardware/software co-simulation to validate system behavior.  
5) Demonstrated final design on FPGA (DE2 board) with real debug scenarios.

Development Progress:
Currently at: Step 7 / 12
1. Study the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
2. Develop a custom assembler for RISC-V
3. Develop an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS)
4. Study the RISC-V supervisor mode
5. Extend the ISS to support supervisor mode
6. Study the RISC-V debug mode
7. Extend the ISS to support debug mode
8. Design a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor
9. Implement supervisor mode support in the processor
10. Implement debug mode support in the processor
11. Perform hardware/software co-simulation
12. Demonstrate the final design on an FPGA
